# Admin Module — Dashboard (`/bennie/dashboard`)

> Part of the [Admin Module](../README.md). The `adminUsers` / `adminRoles` / `adminAuditLog` schemas, the permission taxonomy, the effective-permission formula, and the JWT scope model are defined in the master README and are authoritative here. The shell that frames this page is [admin_layout/admin_layout.md](../admin_layout/admin_layout.md).

## Overview

The **Admin Dashboard** is the landing page rendered at `/bennie/dashboard` immediately after an admin signs in (and after any forced password change clears). It is the operational overwatch summary: a permission-filtered grid of **KPI cards**, a **recent-activity feed** sourced from the audit trail, a **pending-approvals** summary, **quick links** into the sections the admin can enter, and **charts** where real data exists.

Design principle for this pass: **show REAL numbers where the data is live today, and honest placeholders everywhere else.** The user identity plane (`users`) and the admin identity plane (`adminUsers` / `adminRoles` / `adminAuditLog`) are the domains with (or nearest to) live data; the financial and marketplace domains are 📄 planned and MUST render as clearly-labeled **"module not yet live"** placeholder cards rather than fabricated figures.

Status: 📄 **planned** (no admin frontend or `/dashboard` endpoint exists yet).

---

## Purpose & Access

- **First authenticated screen.** After `POST /auth/login` succeeds and `mustChangePassword` is cleared, the SPA routes to `/bennie/dashboard`. It is the default child of the admin shell (see [admin_layout](../admin_layout/admin_layout.md#route-placement)).
- **Access gating.** Reachable only behind the admin `AdminProtectedRoute` (valid admin-scoped session). The dashboard **data endpoint** is guarded by `dashboard:view`; the seeded starter roles (Operations Manager, Finance Officer, Support Agent, Content Manager) all include `dashboard:view`, so the landing page is broadly available. The **Dashboard nav item / page** may be treated as always-visible for any authenticated admin (rendering a minimal card set) even if `dashboard:view` is absent — confirm with owner (see Open Questions); the default assumption here is **`dashboard:view` required** for the aggregated payload.
- **Permission-filtered content.** Individual KPI cards, quick links, and the pending-approvals summary render only for the permissions the admin holds — a Support Agent sees user-oriented cards; finance cards appear only with the relevant `view` permissions.

## KPIs — live-where-possible

Cards are grouped by data-readiness. **Live** cards pull real aggregates from collections that exist (or are the immediate next to exist); **placeholder** cards render a tasteful "module not yet live" card with a muted icon, the metric name, and a small badge — never a fake number.

### Live-capable KPIs (real data)

**Users (`users` collection — ✅ exists on disk):** requires `users:view` to render the card.

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| Total users | `count(users where isDeleted != true)` |
| Active users | `count(users where isActive == true && isSuspended != true && isBanned != true)` — optionally "active in last 30d" via `lastLoginAt` (label the definition used) |
| New signups (7d / 30d) | `count(users where createdAt >= now-7d)` and `>= now-30d` |
| Verified vs unverified | `count(isEmailVerified == true)` vs `false`; and, once KYC ships, `kyc.status` breakdown (Pending/Verified/Rejected) |
| Suspended / banned | `count(isSuspended)` / `count(isBanned)` — surfaces as a small risk stat |

**Admin plane (`adminUsers` / `adminRoles` / `adminAuditLog` — 📄, but the domain nearest to live and owned by this module):** requires `admins:view` / `roles:view` / `audit-logs:view` respectively.

| KPI | Definition |
|-----|------------|
| Total admins | `count(adminUsers where isActive == true)` |
| Admins by role | grouped count over `adminRoles` (e.g. 1 Super Admin, 2 Finance, …) |
| Recent admin activity (24h) | `count(adminAuditLog where createdAt >= now-24h)` |
| Locked-out / must-change-password | operational hygiene counts from `adminUsers` |

### Placeholder KPIs (module not yet live — 📄)

Render as labeled placeholder cards, **no fabricated numbers**. Each shows the metric name, a muted icon, and a **"Module not yet live"** badge; hovering/tooltip explains it will populate when the domain ships.

| Domain | Placeholder cards |
|--------|-------------------|
| Wallet & transactions (PRD 02) | Total wallet balance, deposits/withdrawals (7/30d), pending withdrawals |
| Savings (PRD 04) | Total savings AUM, active plans, interest accrued |
| Shares & dividends (PRD 05) | Shares outstanding, share price, dividends distributed |
| Equipment (PRD 06) | Bookings today, utilization, active GPS units |
| Services (PRD 07) | Bookings, escrow held, disputes open |
| Marketplace (PRD 08) | Orders (7/30d), GMV, refunds pending, products awaiting moderation |
| Adashe (PRD 09) | Active groups, pool balance, payouts due |
| Agents (PRD 10) | Active agents, referrals (30d), commission pending |

> As each domain's collections come online, its placeholder cards become live cards driven by the same `/dashboard/overview` aggregation — no layout change required, only the backend `available: true` flag flips.

## Sections (page layout)

1. **KPI card grid.** Responsive grid (1-col mobile → 2 → 3/4 desktop). Each card: label, value (or placeholder), a small delta/trend chip where a comparison window exists (e.g. signups vs prior 7d), and an icon. Cards are permission-filtered and readiness-grouped (live first, placeholders after, or interleaved with a subtle "coming soon" treatment).
2. **Recent-activity feed.** A reverse-chronological list from `adminAuditLog` (latest ~10–20): actor (name/email), human action label (e.g. "banned user Amina Bello", "changed withdrawal fee"), target, relative timestamp, and source IP on hover. Gated by `audit-logs:view`; when absent, the feed shows a "you don't have access to the activity feed" empty-state instead of the list. Links each entry into the relevant section where a target route exists.
3. **Pending-approvals summary.** A compact panel counting items awaiting admin sign-off across queues — KYC submissions, withdrawals/settlements, membership applications, product moderation, dividend/commission payouts, disputes. **Until those modules exist**, this panel renders a placeholder ("Approval queues activate as modules go live") with zeroed/greyed rows; the one queue that can be real earlier (KYC) lights up first once `users.kyc` ships. Each row deep-links to its queue and respects the relevant permission.
4. **Quick links.** Permission-filtered shortcut tiles to sections the admin can enter (Users, Admins & Roles, Cooperative, Settings, …) — mirrors the sidebar gating but as large actionable tiles for the most common first actions.
5. **Charts (real data only).** A **signups trend** line/area chart (new `users` per day over 30d, from `createdAt` buckets) — the one chart with genuine live data at this stage. Optionally an **admin-activity sparkline** from `adminAuditLog` counts. Placeholder domains show a muted "chart activates when the module is live" tile rather than an empty axis. All charts have accessible table fallbacks.

## Backend

The dashboard is driven by a single aggregation endpoint (📄 **to be implemented by `backend-dev`**):

### GET /api/v1/admin/dashboard/overview 📄
**Required permission:** `dashboard:view`
**Description:** Server-side aggregation returning the live counts the dashboard can render today, plus explicit readiness flags for not-yet-live domains so the frontend renders placeholders deterministically (no client-side guessing).
**Guards:** `AdminJwtGuard` + `PermissionsGuard('dashboard:view')`; subject to the `mustChangePassword` gate (blocked with `403 ADMIN_AUTH_007` until cleared).
**Query (optional):** `range` (`7d` | `30d`, default `30d`) for windowed counts.
**Response:** 200 OK

      "adashe": { "available": false }, "agents": { "available": false }
    }
  }
}
```
**Behaviour notes:**
- Every domain block carries an **`available` boolean**. `true` ⇒ render real values; `false` ⇒ render the "module not yet live" placeholder. This keeps the frontend honest and decouples it from which collections happen to exist.
- The endpoint **omits** (or returns `available:false` for) blocks the caller's permissions don't allow, so a Support Agent's payload never leaks finance aggregates.
- Counts respect soft-delete (`users.isDeleted != true`) and exclude system/seed noise where appropriate.
- **Caching:** aggregates may be cached briefly (e.g. 30–60s) to protect the DB; `recentActivity` should be fresh (or short TTL). Cache key includes the caller's effective-permission scope.
**Audit:** reads only — a low-noise `dashboard.view` audit entry is **optional** (the master README treats reads as generally un-audited except PII/financial exports). Do **not** audit every dashboard poll.
**Errors:** `403 ADMIN_AUTH_006` (missing `dashboard:view`), `403 ADMIN_AUTH_007` (`mustChangePassword`), standard envelope.

> **Flagged 📄 for `backend-dev`.** This endpoint does not exist yet. It aggregates over the live `users` collection and the admin-plane collections; as new domains ship, extend the aggregation and flip each `available` flag to `true`. The frontend requires no change when a flag flips.

## Design & Accessibility

**Premium, responsive, motion-rich — not a basic UI.** Consistent with the shell's brand tokens.

- **Brand:** primary `#135D39`, accent `#E7A13C`; **Space Grotesk** headings, **Inter** body, **JetBrains Mono** for numeric KPI values and ids. Cards use soft elevation, clear hierarchy, and accent sparingly (accent reserved for the primary KPI / positive delta).
- **Motion (`motion`):** KPI values count-up on first load; cards stagger-in; chart draws on mount; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Responsive:** KPI grid reflows 1→2→3/4 columns across mobile/tablet/desktop; activity feed and charts stack under the grid on mobile.
- **States (all required):**
  - **Loading / skeleton:** every card, the feed, and charts show shimmer skeletons matching their final shape while `/dashboard/overview` resolves.
  - **Empty:** a domain with zero real data (e.g. no signups yet) shows a friendly zero-state, distinct from the **placeholder** ("module not yet live") state — the two must be visually distinguishable.
  - **Placeholder:** muted card + "Module not yet live" badge; no numbers.
  - **Error:** a retriable error card if the overview call fails (no blank dashboard).
  - **Permission-limited:** cards/feed the admin can't see are simply absent (not greyed), except placeholder-domain cards which are informational.
- **Accessibility:** cards are landmarked/labeled; KPI values have accessible text; charts ship an accessible data-table fallback; the activity feed is a semantic list; full keyboard nav and visible focus; contrast ≥ WCAG AA.

## Dependencies

- **[admin_layout/admin_layout.md](../admin_layout/admin_layout.md)** — the shell; the dashboard is its default child; reuses the permission-filtered nav gating for quick links.
- **[auth/admin_auth.md](../auth/admin_auth.md)** — `GET /auth/me` (`effectivePermissions`, `mustChangePassword`), `dashboard:view` semantics, `ADMIN_AUTH_006/007`.
- **[users/users.md](../users/users.md)** — source domain for the user KPIs and the KYC approval queue that lights up first.
- **[admins/admins.md](../admins/admins.md)** — `adminAuditLog` shape (feed) and admin-plane counts.
- **[data_structure.md §2.1 `users`, §7.1–§7.3 admin plane, §5–§6 dual-session](../../data_structure.md#7-admin-module--identity-rbac-config)** — schema cross-reference and the `adminApi` client the dashboard calls.

## Open Questions for the Owner

1. **`dashboard:view` requirement vs. always-visible landing.** Should `/bennie/dashboard` always render a minimal card set for *any* authenticated admin (so nobody lands on a 403), or strictly require `dashboard:view` for the aggregated payload? Default assumption: require `dashboard:view` for `/dashboard/overview`, but let the page shell render with an empty/limited state if absent.
2. **"Active user" definition.** Confirm whether "active users" means *not suspended/banned* (status-based) or *logged in within 30 days* (`lastLoginAt`-based). The KPI card should state whichever definition is chosen.
3. **Read-auditing the dashboard.** Confirm the dashboard overview read is **not** audited (avoid audit-log noise from polling); PII/financial **exports** remain audited per the master README.
